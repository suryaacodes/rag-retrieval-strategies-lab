# 🔬 RAG Retrieval Strategies Lab

A focused experimentation repository for evaluating retrieval strategies
used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## Overview
This repository contains controlled experiments and evaluation notebooks
that analyze how different retrieval techniques impact RAG performance.

The goal of this repo is not to build a production system, but to
validate retrieval design decisions quantitatively before deploying
them in a larger architecture.
